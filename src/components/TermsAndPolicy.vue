              The Service may create aggregate usage reports for advertisers and
              partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more
              effectively and allow our users to receive advertisements that are
              relevant to their needs . <b>Esele</b> never shares individual
              personal information with anyone, so an advertiser will never know
              a specific user clicked on that advertiser's advertisement.
